# Layout Update Progress Report

## Completed Tasks:

1. Created a new `DocumentTableOfContents` component (at `src/components/docs/document-toc.tsx`) that:
   - Automatically finds headings in the content
   - Uses IntersectionObserver to track which headings are in view
   - Highlights the active section
   - Provides smooth scrolling to sections

2. Created a new `DocsPageLayout` component (at `src/components/docs/docs-page-layout.tsx`) that:
   - Provides a consistent three-column layout for all documentation pages
   - Has a consistent max-width of 1600px
   - Uses the existing DocsSidebar for navigation
   - Supports the new DocumentTableOfContents on the right side
   - Can conditionally hide the table of contents for pages where it's not needed

3. Successfully updated the following pages to use the new layout:
   - Form Controller Overview (`src/app/logic/form-controller/overview/page.tsx`)
   - Form Controller API (`src/app/logic/form-controller/api/page.tsx`)
   - Form Controller Examples (`src/app/logic/form-controller/examples/page.tsx`)
   - Form Controller Extensibility (`src/app/logic/form-controller/extensibility/page.tsx`)
   - Privacy Policy (`src/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`)
   - Getting Started (partially updated, was already using DocsPageLayout but needed to fix the closing tag)

## Remaining Tasks:

1. Fix the issues in the Analytics page (`src/app/analytics/page.tsx`):
   - The page is quite complex with multiple nested sections
   - Recommended approach: Create a new file and carefully adapt the content section by section
   - Consider whether all the current sections are still needed with the new layout

2. Update the Contact Us page:
   - The page needs careful review as it contains an interactive form with analytics tracking
   - The form may need adjustments to fit within the new layout

3. Test the layout changes:
   - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Verify the table of contents scroll behavior functions correctly
   - Ensure all navigation components remain accessible

4. Apply the same layout pattern to any new documentation pages created in the future
   - Create a documentation template or guide for consistency

## Notes for Development Team:

- The layout approach is now standardized and should be used for all documentation pages
- The max-width of 1600px is applied consistently across the documentation
- The main content area is placed within a properly centered container
- Navigation and table of contents use a consistent design language

The new layout system makes the documentation more scannable, consistent, and easier to navigate, especially for longer pages where the table of contents serves as a quick reference guide.
