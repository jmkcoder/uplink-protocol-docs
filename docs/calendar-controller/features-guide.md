Ready-to-use examples with:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive styling
- **Font Awesome**: Beautiful calendar icons and navigation elements

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly structure
- ARIA attributes in the example implementations

## Advanced Features

### Service-Oriented Architecture

The controller uses specialized services for different concerns:

- **CalendarService**: Core calendar operations
- **DateSelectionService**: Selection logic
- **DateValidationService**: Date constraints and validation
- **DateFormattingService**: Consistent date formatting
- **NavigationService**: Calendar navigation operations
- **ViewStateService**: UI state management
- **EventManagerService**: Event handling
- **ConstraintsService**: Date constraints management
- **CalendarGeneratorService**: Calendar day generation
- **ConfigurationService**: Configuration management

### Calendar Generation

- Automatic generation of calendar days for the current view
- Proper handling of days from previous and next months
- Special styling for today, selected dates, and date ranges

### Multiple View Modes

The controller provides multiple ways to navigate and select dates through different view modes:

#### Day View

The traditional calendar view showing days of a month:
- View days in a month grid
- Select individual days
- Navigate between months
- See previous and next month days

#### Month View

A grid of months for quick month selection:

#### Year View

A range of years for selecting a specific year:

- Visual indicators for the current year
- Disabled indicators for years outside valid date range

#### Year Range Navigation

Methods to efficiently navigate through years:
- `nextYearRange()`: Move to the next set of years
- `prevYearRange()`: Move to the previous set of years
- `goToYearRange(year)`: Jump to a specific year range
- `getCurrentYearRange()`: Get information about the current year range
- `setYearRangeSize(size)`: Customize how many years are displayed in the year view

## Integration with Uplink Protocol

As part of the Uplink Protocol ecosystem, this component:

- Uses the core Uplink binding system for reactive updates
- Follows Uplink controller patterns for consistent API design
- Integrates with other Uplink Protocol components
